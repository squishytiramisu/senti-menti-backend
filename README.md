# Usage
To interact with the backend, I recommend using the frontend created for this project: https://github.com/squishytiramisu/Sentimenti-UI/tree/master

``` bash
docker compose up -d db
# Start the Kotlin project
# Run the UI 
```

1. Navigate to localhost:3000
2. Click on the Login button
3. Create and account named admin
4. Go to the settings page
5. Add one ticker
6. Click on the collect news button
7. Go to the dashboard and click on that one ticker
8. Go back to settings and press the analyze news button
9. If it is done analyzing, you can view the results on your dashboard
10. You may add more tickers but the API costs are $$$
